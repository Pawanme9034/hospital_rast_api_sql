Introduction:

In this Python project, we have developed a REST API for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a patient database. The primary goal of this project is to provide a convenient and efficient way to manage patient records through HTTP requests.

By utilizing a RESTful architecture, we've designed a set of endpoints that allow users to interact with the patient database seamlessly. Whether it's retrieving patient information, adding new patients, updating existing records, or deleting entries, our API provides a comprehensive solution for managing patient data.
